# "Swiss German" Mac Keyboard Layout for Developers

## The problem

If you are a developer working normally on a Mac keyboard, you know the problems, when you have to do your work on a keyboard with PC layout:
Suddenly you are missing keys like `@[]{}\|`

Even worse: If you try to connect the Mac keyboard to a Windows PC you suddenly see the keys `<` and `ยง` are swapped!?


## The solution

I had exactly above issue: I've added a PC to my computer setup and wanted to use the Apple Magic Keyboard with all my computers. After installing Windows on my PC, I had the impression that it was nearly unusable (mainly because I didn't know the SG PC layout by hard and because two keys were swapped).
After a long web search I've come to the conclusion that there was no such thing ready to download... but Microsoft provided a tool called **Microsoft Kayboard Layout Creator** [(available here)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) which can be installed on Windows 10 after resolving .NET framework dependencies [(see here)](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/microsoft-keyboard-layout-creator-14-instalation/092881f1-470b-4a66-889f-59e868c6b25a).

It's a rather good tool, but I had to realize that Windows does not support the `alt` and `alt + shift` combinations. This is why I used `altgr` (=`ctrl + alt`) and `altgr + shift` as replacement four our beloved combinations.

With this setup I was able to create the `SG-Mac.klc` and `SG-Mac_S.klc` keyboard mappings.


## The conclusion

With the keyboard mappings provided here, it is possible to find the relevant keys, but nevertheless our brain has to adjust. Instead of pressing `alt + shift + 7` for a `\` key, you will have to press `ctrl + alt + shift + 7` (= one key more), or if your keyboard has `altgr` (right beside the spacebar), you can use `altgr + shift + 7`.
